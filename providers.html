	<h2 id="ec2">EC2</h2>
	The <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a> provider automatically creates a volume for bootstrapping
	(be it EBS or S3), makes a snapshot of it once it is done and registers it as an AMI.
	EBS volume backing only works on an EC2 host while S3 backed volumes <i>should</i> work locally
	(at this time however they do not, a fix is in the works).<br/>
	Unless <a href="plugins.html#cloud_init">the cloud-init plugin</a> is used, special startup scripts
	will be installed that automatically fetch the configured authorized_key from the instance metadata
	and save or run any userdata supplied (if the userdata begins with <tt>#!</tt> it will be run).
</p>
<p>
	<h3>Credentials</h3>
	The AWS credentials can be configured in two ways: Via the manifest or through environment variables.
	To bootstrap S3 backed instances you will need a user certificate and a private key in addition to the
	access key and secret key, which are needed for bootstraping EBS backed instances.
	The <a href="manifest.html#credentials">manifest documentation</a> goes in to detail on how
	you can configure this.
</p>
<p>
	<h3>Dependencies</h3>
	To communicate with the AWS API <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto">boto</a>
	is required (version 2.14.0 or higher) you can install boto with <tt>pip install boto</tt>
	(on wheezy, the packaged version is too low).
	S3 images are chopped up and uploaded using <a href="https://github.com/eucalyptus/euca2ools">euca2ools</a>
	(install with <tt>apt-get install euca2ools</tt>).
</p>

<p>
	<h2 id="gce">Google Compute Engine</h2>
	The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine/">GCE</a> provider can creates image
	as expected by GCE - i.e. raw disk image in *.tar.gz file. It can upload created images to Google
	Storage Engine (to URI provided in manifest by <tt>gcs_destination</tt>) and can register image
	to be used by Google Compute Engine to project provided in manifest by <tt>gce_project</tt>.
	Both of those functionalities are not fully tested yet.

</p>

<p>
	<h2 id="vbox">VirtualBox</h2>
	The <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> provider can bootstrap to both .vdi and .vmdk images
	(raw images are also supported but do not run in VirtualBox).
	It's advisable to always use vmdk images for interoperability
	(e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format">OVF</a> files <i>should</i>
	support vdi files, but since they have no identifier URL not even VirtualBox itself can import them).
	VirtualBox Guest Additions can be installed automatically if the ISO is
	<a href="manifest.html#bootstrapper">provided in the manifest</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<h2 id="kvm">KVM</h2>
	The <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">KVM</a> provider creates virtual images for
	Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machines.
	It supports the installation of <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">virtio kernel modules</a>
	(paravirtualized drivers for IO operations).
